# Simple Village Game - Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the Simple Village Game application and verify that it's working correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Java 17 or higher installed
2. Maven installed
3. MongoDB running on localhost:27017
   - If you don't have MongoDB installed, you can run it using Docker:
     ```
     docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
     ```

## Running the Application

1. Navigate to the project root directory
2. Run the application using Maven:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
3. The application will start on port 8080
4. You should see a message "üè∞ Prosta Gra Osadnicza uruchomiona!" in the console

## Testing the API Endpoints

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [curl](https://curl.se/), or any HTTP client to test the API endpoints.

## Complete Test Workflow

Here's a complete workflow to test the application:

1. Create two players
2. Create a village for each player
3. Update resources for both players
4. Increase population for both villages
5. Recruit warriors for both villages
6. Build buildings in both villages
7. Perform an attack from one player to another
8. Check the event logs
9. Create a trade between the players
10. Accept the trade
11. Check the updated resources

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017
2. Check the application logs for any error messages
3. Verify that you're using the correct IDs in your requests
4. Ensure you're using the correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT) for each endpoint
